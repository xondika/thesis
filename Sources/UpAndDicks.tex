The included videos \textsc{around\_wall.mp4}, \textsc{through\_hole.mp4}, \textsc{obstacles\_near\_target.mp4}, \textsc{obstacles\_around.mp4} showcase the movement of a robotic manipulator in the discussed examples. The videos were taken using the RoFI physics-free simulator.

The file \texttt{RoFI.zip} contains a snapshot of the RoFI repository.
If you wish to reproduce the results of the algorithm and run your own simulation, download the necessary dependencies and run the RoFI environment as described in our documentation~\cite{documentation}.
After setting up the environment, configure for desktop and build the \texttt{rofi-cofi} tool.
For specific information on the tool, refer to \texttt{RoFI/tools/ik/readme.md}. To visualize the result of an algorithm, redirect the standard output of the tool to a file and view it by calling \texttt{rofi-vis -i path\_to\_file}.
