\chapter{Evaluation}

In previous chapters, we've made fairly extensive reasoning behind each part of the algorithm. However, we have yet to see how the algorithm will perform as a whole. In this chapter, the algorithm is tested in various situations.

\section{Quality of the Trajectory}

First part of the evaluation consists of putting the algorithm up against handcrafted sets of obstacles. We can view how particular edge cases are handled, how natural the overall motion is, and if there are any situations it cannot reasonably deal with.

\section{Performance}

This section is about benchmarking the algorithm.
